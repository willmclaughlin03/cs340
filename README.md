How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable all comes down to your understanding of the aspects that go together to create a project. Researching, then understanding and writing the code in a structured, methodical manner, with comments and even notes to yourself allows you to write better code and is a huge advantage. I could use the CRUD module when building my own project like it, or just simply as a reference point when I am struggling in the future to slow things and break things down.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching problems as computer scientist is a slow methodical process, that involves research and reading of documentation, as well as a good memory to structure and understand the code and problems you must face. My approach in this project didn't really differ at all, as all projects and assignments really require this. I would use the same strategy of reading and researching then slowly writing efficent code in the future.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

CS create code to solve problems that are faced by themselves or clients. This matters as it can better people's lives or solve inefficenies in areas needing help. In the case of this project, our project helped dogs be adopted and trained to save lives, saving a company time when responding to disasters, and helping save lives of people everywhere.
